            I highly recommend all new coders start a running
            Practice page.
            <br>
            Each time you learn something new, add it to your
            practice page.
        </p>
        [1] This is a valid HTML5 line of text, without 
        surrounding p-tags.
        <p>
            [2] Text between the title-tags might be used by 
            search engines.
        </p>
        <p>
            [3] The br-tag acts like a newline sequence (similar 
            to "\n").
