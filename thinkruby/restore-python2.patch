+#### 1\.3\.4 Experimental debugging
+
+One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be
+frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and
+interesting parts of programming.
+
+In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues, and
+you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.
+
+Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is
+going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct,
+then you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a
+working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new
+one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out,
+
+> "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever
+> remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
+> ---A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four
+
+For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is,
+programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you
+want. The idea is that you should start with a program that does *something* and
+make small modifications, debugging them as you go, so that you always have a
+working program.
+
+For example, Linux is an operating system that contains thousands of lines of code,
+but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386
+chip. According to Larry Greenfield,
+
+> "One of Linus's earlier projects was a program that would
+> switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved
+> to Linux."
+> ---The Linux Users' Guide, Beta Version 1
+
+Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other
+programming practices.
