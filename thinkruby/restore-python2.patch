+### 1\.4 Formal and natural languages
+
+**Natural languages** are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and
+French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some
+order on them); they evolved naturally.
+
+**Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific
+applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal
+language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and
+symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of
+molecules. And most importantly:
+
+&#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0;**Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed**
+&#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0;**to express computations.** 
+
+Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, 3 + 3 = 6 is a
+syntactically correct mathematical statement, but 3+ = 3$6 is not. *H&#x2082;O* is a
+syntactically correct chemical formula, but *&#x2082;Zz* is not.
+
+Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to **tokens** and structure. Tokens are the
+basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements.
+One of the problems with 3+ = 3$6 is that *$* is not a legal token in mathematics (at
+least as far as I know). Similarly, *&#x2082;Zz* is not legal because there is no element with
+the abbreviation *Zz*.
+
+The second type of syntax rule pertains to the **structure of a statement**, that is, the
+way the tokens are arranged. The statement 3+ = 3 is illegal because even though + and
+= are legal tokens, you can't have one right after the other. Similarly, in a
+chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before.
+
+When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have
+to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language
+you do this subconsciously). This process is called **parsing**.
+
+For example, when you hear the sentence, "The penny dropped," you understand that
+"the penny" is the subject and "dropped" is the predicate. Once you have parsed a
+sentence, you can figure out what it means, or the semantics of the sentence.
+Assuming that you know what a penny is and what it means to drop, you will
+understand the general implication of this sentence.
